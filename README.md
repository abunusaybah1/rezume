# Rezume Portfolio Builder

## Project Overview

Portfolio Builder is a frontend web application that allows users to easily create a personal portfolio website by filling in their details through a simple form. As users input their information, a live preview of the portfolio is generated instantly.

This project was built as a final frontend project for ALX, focusing on user interface design, state management, and real-world frontend logic — without using any backend services.

- Demonstrate strong understanding of frontend development concepts
- Practice component-based architecture
