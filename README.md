# Rezume — Resume Builder with Live Preview

## Overview

Rezume is a frontend web application that helps users create a clean, professional resume by filling in their details through a simple form. As users type, a live preview of the resume updates instantly. The app is designed to be fast, minimal, and easy to use, with automatic data persistence in the browser.

Rezume focuses on core resume sections (profile, summary, skills, and projects) and provides multiple layout templates for a polished final result — without requiring any account or backend.
