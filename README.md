# Rezume — Resume Builder with Live Preview

## Overview

Rezume is a frontend web application for building a clean, professional resume through a simple form with instant live preview. As users type, the resume updates in real time. Data is saved automatically in the browser, so users can leave and continue later without losing progress.
